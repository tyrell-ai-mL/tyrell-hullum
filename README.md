🚀 Hi, I'm Tyrell Hullum 👋

AI & Data Science | Computer Vision | Databricks | Deep Learning

Welcome to my portfolio. I'm building intelligent systems that combine YOLO object detection, lane detection, self-driving car behavior cloning, and Databricks data engineering pipelines.

I’m focused on real-world AI, ML Ops, and data engineering that creates impact.

📂 Current Projects
🔹 traffic-yolo/ — YOLOv8 Traffic Object Detection

Real-time detection of cars, buses, and pedestrians with custom color-coded bounding boxes and professional overlays.

Includes:

labeled_preview_pro.mp4 — Final polished demo

overlay_rainynight.py — OpenCV/YOLO overlay script

Frames + labels for the rainy-night dataset

Model visualization and preprocessing pipeline

Demo video (rainy-night traffic detection):
[View labeled_preview_pro.mp4]

🔹 lane-detection/ — Lane Detection using OpenCV

Classic CV pipeline used in self-driving systems.
Includes:

Canny edge detection

Region masking

Hough line transforms

Overlay pipeline for video output

🔹 behavior-cloning/ — Self-Driving Car Steering Model (Keras)

A neural network trained end-to-end on real driving frames.
Predicts steering angles using behavioral cloning (Udacity-style project).

🔹 databricks-pipelines/ — Delta Live Tables & ETL Pipelines
