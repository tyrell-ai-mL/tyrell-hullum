# Self-Driving Car — Behavior Cloning (Keras)

Placeholder folder for my behavior cloning project.

This model:
- Trains a neural network from driving images + steering angles  
- Predicts steering decisions from front-facing camera frames  
- Uses Keras, NumPy, and OpenCV  
- Runs inside a real-time driving simulator

Full code, training pipeline, and demo video coming soon.
